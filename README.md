`treewe` is an open-source Python library that implements state-of-the-art energy and weather prediction models for use cases including as wind, solar and demand forecasting. It is using the [`enflow`](https://github.com/rebase-energy/enflow) structure to evaluate and benchmark prediction models in a reproducible manner. `treewe` lets you: 

* üîÑ Get a unified syntax for working with state-of-the-art tree-based predictor libraries such as [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost), [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM), [CatBoost](https://github.com/catboost/catboost) and [Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn);
* üìä Run and evaluate pre-implemented prediction models on your own energy and weather datasets; and
* üìà Create your own prediction model and benchmark it against pre-implemented prediction models;

## Basic Usage
`treewe` uses [`enflow`](https://github.com/rebase-energy/enflow) structure for creating the basic evaluation loop that avoids data leakage and ensures reproducibility. An experiment is represented by the following 4 components: 

* [`Dataset`]()
* [`Environment`]()
* [`Objective`]()
* [`Predictor`]()

Given a defined `dataset`, `env` (environment), `agent` (model) and `obj` (objective), the sequential decision loop is given by: 

```python
# Create the env, agent and obj. Your code goes in defining these classes. 
env = GEFCom2014WindEnv()
obj = PinballLoss(quantiles=np.arange(0.1, 1, 0.1))
predictor = LGBGEFCom2014Predictor()

state = env.reset()
next_input, initial_df = env.reset()
predictor1.train(features=initial_df["features"], target=initial_df["target"])

done = False
while done is not True:
    prediction = predictor.predict(features=next_input)
    next_input, next_target, done = env.step()
    loss = obj.calculate(next_target, prediction)

env.close()
```
